For this week I mostly did refactoring and cleaning up the code. I configured test coverage to cover relevant parts of the code. I removed some legacy code which was not used after the optimizations.  I refactored the plotting functions and tried to make them show relevant graphs regardless of the given parameters. I created a new plot to compare the cost for training and evaluation. I removed also quite a lot of duplicate code and refactored some parts where the linter was complaining.

I did the code review which was a bit difficult because the project was in rust and I have never used it. But it was interesting to try to understand language of which syntax I did not know. I hope the review makes some sense. I got a very nice review which pointed out some relevant issues which I fixed.  I also ran a longer training with different parameters for comparison and posted that on the testing document.
