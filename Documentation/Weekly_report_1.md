I started the course by researching different algorithms to decide which one to implement. As I wished to build 
something in the domain of computer vision, implementing a simple neural network seemed to be a logical choice. The 
classical case was image recognition from Mnist dataset and so it was easy choice as I have not much experience with the 
subject and there are plenty of tutorials and material about implementing neural networks on Mnist. I guess optimizing the 
network will also provide extra work if needed. I decided to work with python as that is the language most of the examples
can be found. I’m also enough proficient with python and this project also provides me a chance to learn to utilize it in a new domain. 

I spent time reading a lot about neural nets in general but learned most by watching 
[these excellent videos by 3Blue1Brown.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
Consequently, I have a grasp of the basic math involved and the structure of the code I will implement. I tried to figure out
the time complexity for my neural network but didn’t have time to fully understand the subject as there are quite many 
algorithms at work so it’s a topic I have to delve deeper into. This is also a subject I might need some help with as the 
subject might be beyond my math skills. 

Next I will start to implement the neural net and learn about unit testing in python as that is a bit grey area to me. 

I spent propably around 10 hours in total this week. Most of it went to research and to choosing the subject so no code yet.
